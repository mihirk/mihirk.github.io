        <p>Open Source Hospital Information System</p>

        Bahmni is an open source Hospital Information System (HIS) that aims to meet the needs of hospitals in low
        resource
        environments by creating a tapestry of existing open source products that work well in their own context.

        Bahmni integrates OpenMRS, OpenERP, OpenELIS and JasperReports to create a robust HIS.

        - [OpenMRS](http://openmrs.org/) is a mature open source medical records management system. The system is under
        active development, and has a vibrant community of developers and
        [organizations](http://openmrs.org/about/support/)
        and has several successful [implementations](http://openmrs.org/atlas/) across the world.

        - [OpenERP](https://www.openerp.com/) is an established open source ERP system that is ideal for supporting
        business
        applications and administrative functions. There are several functionalities that OpenERP offers out of the box.
        It
        is also particularly amenable to modifications to suit specific organizational needs.

        - [OpenELIS](http://www.openelis.org/) is a laboratory information system. The primary focus of the application
        is
        to streamline the laboratory workflow.

        We believe that the three systems are arguably among the best open source products available today. We aim to
        provide integration options between OpenMRS, OpenERP and OpenELIS so that they can be used either as a complete
        suite of products, or a combination thereof.

        The Bahmni team is also actively working with OpenMRS to create a new user interface that can be used at the
        point
        of care. We have made significant performance/stability improvements to OpenELIS and improved the visibility of
        pending workload for the lab. We have also developed custom functionality for OpenERP to handle the billing and
        inventory requirements of one particular hospital.

        Bahmni is currently deployed at [Jan Swasthya Sahyog, Bilaspur](http://jssbilaspur.org/about/).
